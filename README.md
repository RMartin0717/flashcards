# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Abstract
This project allows the user to play a flash card game in the command line and was my first time writing test suites to drive my code.  My biggest learning goals going in were to spend time understanding how to break a project down into individual steps before beginning to code and learn how to test for different functionalities. As a bonus, I gained a better understanding of working between multiple classes.

## Install/Setup instructions
In order to play the flash card game, clone down this repo to your local command line. Once you have installed the repo, run `node index.js` from the root of the project. The first flash card will immediately display its question in the command line and as a user, you must select the correct answer by using the up and down arrow keys and clicking "enter" when the answer you want to select is of a different color. The command line will tell you if your answer is correct and when you hit "enter" again, will display the question from the next card. Once all of the cards in the deck have been used, the percent correct is returned to the you.
